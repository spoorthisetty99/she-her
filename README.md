In a woman’s life in India, the societal pressure to get married and “be settled” by the age of 30 is often a crushing one, one that leads to hasty decisions and unhealthy marriages. When rushed marriages lead to a toxic household, inevitably failing, Indian women are expected to put up with it, since the life of a divorced woman in India is often viewed as worse than facing the occasional abuse at home.

When it comes to divorce, even seemingly progressive individuals suddenly cower with a terrified gaze, pleading with the woman to consider any option but divorce. Granted, life after divorce for women is no walk in the park, but the stigma around it makes it a lot worse.

We aim to provide a platform for divorced and to-be divorced women in the form of support groups with various domains dealing with the many issues faced by these women. 

We will be focusing solely on three major domains: 

1. Financial 
Education to reach financial stability and independence 
2. Legal 
Providing connections to lawyers who will help them through the process of separation and child custody as well as alimony settlements
3. Emotional 
Referring one to a therapist who helps with co-parenting, societal backlash and overall mental well-being 
Support groups where women can share their experiences
